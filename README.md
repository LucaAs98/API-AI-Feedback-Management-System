# Feedback Analysis API

## Overview

The Feedback Analysis API is a powerful backend service designed to handle user registration, feedback submission, and sentiment analysis. It leverages modern technologies and artificial intelligence to provide a seamless and secure experience for users, allowing them to interact with feedback data and obtain insightful analytics.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login for users using JWT.
- **Feedback Management:** CRUD operations for managing user feedback.
- **Sentiment Analysis Integration:** Automatically analyzes feedback using AI to classify sentiment.
- **Secure Middleware:** Employs security measures to protect API endpoints and data.

## Technologies Used

### Back-End

- **Node.js** + **Express.js**
  - RESTful API architecture for handling requests and responses.
  - JWT for secure user authentication and session management.
  - Middleware for enhanced security (e.g., Helmet.js and CORS).

### Artificial Intelligence

- **AWS Lambda** + **Sentiment Analysis API**
  - Integration with AWS Lambda to process feedback through AI services like AWS Comprehend or Azure Cognitive Services for sentiment analysis.
  
### Database

- **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL/MySQL)**
  - Storage for user data and feedback entries.
  - SQL queries for filtering feedback based on various criteria.
  - ORM like Prisma for simplified database interactions.

### Deployment

- **Hosting:**
  - Backend hosted on **AWS EC2** or **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** for robust scalability.
  
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment:**
  - **GitHub Actions** for automating deployment and managing code releases.

## Architecture

1. **API Server (Node.js + Express.js):** Handles incoming requests for user registration, login, feedback submission, and sentiment analysis.
2. **Database (AWS RDS):** Stores user details and feedback records securely.
3. **AWS Lambda + AI Service:** Processes feedback for sentiment analysis and sends results back to the API server.
4. **Security Middleware:** Ensures secure communication between the client and the API, safeguarding user data.

## Development Steps

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Initialize Node.js with Express.js to create the backend structure.

2. **User Authentication Implementation:**
   - Implement JWT-based authentication for user registration and login.

3. **Feedback Management:**
   - Develop CRUD operations for feedback handling (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

4. **Sentiment Analysis Setup:**
   - Configure AWS Lambda to analyze feedback using an AI service.

5. **Database Connection:**
   - Set up AWS RDS and integrate it with the backend for storing user data and feedback.

6. **Deployment and Automation:**
   - Deploy the API on AWS EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk.
   - Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD to streamline deployment processes.

## Benefits of This Project

- **Robust API Design:** Demonstrates a well-structured backend service with secure user management.
- **AI Integration:** Showcases the ability to leverage AI for meaningful data analysis and insights.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Utilizes AWS services to ensure scalability and reliability of the API.
- **Security Focus:** Implements best practices for API security to protect user data and interactions.

## Cost Considerations

Many AWS services, including Lambda, RDS, and EC2, are available under the free tier, allowing for initial development without additional costs. While AWS Comprehend may incur charges for advanced features, alternative free options like open-source models hosted on EC2 can also be utilized for initial testing and development.
